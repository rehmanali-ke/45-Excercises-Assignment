/*Excercise No.22
Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your
prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

let car = 'subaru';

console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

console.log(car == 'subaru')

• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.*/
let five = 5;
let ten = 10;
//Test 1
console.log(`Test 1: five is equal to 5`);
console.log(five == 5);
//Test 2
console.log(`Test 2: ten is equal to 10`);
console.log(ten == 10);
//Test 3
console.log(`Test 3: five is not equal to 10`);
console.log(five !== 10);
//Test 4
console.log(`Test 4: five is smaller than 10`);
console.log(five < 10);
//Test 5
console.log(`Test 5: ten is greater than 7`);
console.log(10 > 7);
//Test 6
console.log(`Test 6: ten is greater than 20`);
console.log(ten > 20);
//Test 7
console.log(`Test 7: five is not equal to 5`);
console.log(five !== 5);
// Test 8
console.log(`Test 8: ten is equal to 5`);
console.log(ten == 5);
//Test 9
console.log(`Test 9: ten is not equal to 10`);
console.log(ten !== 10);
// Test 10
console.log(`Test 10: 20 is smaller than ten`);
console.log(20 < 10);
